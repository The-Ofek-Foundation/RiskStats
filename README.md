# RiskStats
Test out dice rolling strategies for Risk

Simply modify the code for the simulateBattles function in RiskStats per the comments, and run the code like so:

> RiskStats <num attackers> <num defenders>

For example, if you want to simulate a battle between 10 attackers and 8 defenders, you would run:

> RiskStats 10 8

The program will then output the odds of winning with your defender rolling strategy, along with histograms showing the likelihoods of all the possible end situations.

I recommend using a large command prompt, but if that is not possible, reduce the MAX_SCALE variable in RiskStats accordingly.
